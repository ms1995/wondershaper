Changes since version 1.3 (forked by Saimonn/Camptocamp):
	- move from CBQ to HTB queing.
	  CBQ didn't cope well on a ~100Mbps link : individual downloads
		were ceiling at 3Mbit/s. Moving to HTB allows to really use all the
		available bandwith, event with a single TCP connection, and without
		any caveats on SIP telephony or link reactivity.

Changes since version 1.2 (forked by magnic0):
	- added command-line interface (through options and flags) 
	  that didn't seem to be working before as the options were 
	  hardcoded in the script.

Changes since version 1.1:
	- Georg Wild <georg.wild@gmx.de> noticed that
	  NOPRIOHOSTDST was never used

Changes since version 1.0:

	- we now prioritize ALL small packets, not just acks
	- ability to deprioritize certain source/dst host/ports
